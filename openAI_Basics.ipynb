With few exceptions, it has been staged annually since it was first played during the 1953–54 season. Domestic cricket in Pakistan has undergone many reorganisations, with the number of teams and matches in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy changing regularly. It has been variously contested by associations or departments, or a combination of the two. From 2019–20 to 2022–23 it was contested by six regional teams.

      "Summary: The United Arab Emirates is a high-income developing market economy. The UAE's economy is the 2nd largest in the Middle East (after Saudi Arabia), with a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$415 billion (AED 1.83 trillion) in 2021-2023.The UAE economy is heavily reliant on revenues from petroleum and natural gas, especially in Abu Dhabi. In 2009, more than 85% of the UAE's economy was based on the oil exports. In 2011, oil exports accounted for 77% of the UAE's state budget. In recent years, there has been some economic diversification, particularly in Dubai. Abu Dhabi and other UAE emirates have remained relatively conservative in their approach to diversification. Dubai has far smaller oil reserves than its counterparts.Tourism is one of the biggest non-oil sources of revenue in the UAE. A massive construction boom, an expanding manufacturing base, and a thriving services sector are helping the country to diversify its economy. Nationwide, there is currently US$350 billion worth of active construction projects.The UAE is a member of the World Trade Organization and OPEC.\n",

It joined the United Arab Emirates federation on December 2, 1971. It has an area of 259 square kilometers (100 sq mi), which makes it the smallest of the emirates in terms of area, while its population of approximately 504,846 in 2017 according to the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Center makes it the fourth most populous emirate in the country. It is named after the city of Ajman, which is its seat of government. The main landmass of the emirate is a semi-enclave, surrounded on the north, east, and south by the Emirate of Sharjah.Located on the coast of the Persian Gulf, Ajman also controls two small inland exclaves: Manama and Masfout, both of which are primarily agricultural.  Approximately 95% of the population of the emirate resides in the city of Ajman, which forms part of the Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman metropolitan area. Ajman is ruled by Sheikh Humaid bin Rashid Al Nuaimi III of the Na'im tribe. The Crown Prince of the emirate is Sheikh Ammar bin Humaid Al Nuaimi.\n",

      "Summary: The economy of Dubai represents a per capita gross domestic product as of 2022 of US$46,665. Thani Bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Minister of State for Foreign Trade, announced that the UAE's non-oil trade over 10 years totalled Dhs16.14 trillion ($US 4.4 trillion). The UAE GDP jumping from $407 billion in 2021 to $440 billion in 2022 and $467 billion in 2023. Similarly, per capita GDP will also expand from $43,868 in 2021 to $46,665 in 2022 and $48,822 in 2023.The International Herald Tribune described it as \"centrally-planned free-market capitalism\". Oil production, which once accounted for 50% of Dubai's gross domestic product, contributes less than 1% today. In 2018, wholesale and retail trade represented 26% of the total GDP; transport and logistics, 12%; banking, insurance activities and capital markets, 10%; manufacturing, 9%; real estate, 7%; construction, 6%; tourism, 5%.Dubai became important ports of call for Western manufacturers. Most of the new city's banking and financial centres were headquartered in the port area. Dubai maintained its importance as a trade route through the 1970s and 1980s. The city of Dubai has a free trade in gold and until the 1990s was the hub of a \"brisk smuggling trade\" of gold ingots to India, where gold import was restricted.\n",
      "Today, Dubai has focused its economy on tourism by building hotels and developing real estate. Port Jebel Ali, constructed in the 1970s, has the largest man-made harbor in the world, but is also increasingly developing as a hub for service industries such as IT and finance, with the new Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC).
